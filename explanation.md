# HOW BROWSERS WORK

## Introduction

### Definition
**What is a Browser?**
A Web Browser or Browser as commonly refered, is a software application installed on a computer for retrieving, presenting, and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web.
An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) and may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content or technology.
Web pages and other resources are interprated by the browser which displays them on the screen.
Some browsers will translate only text while others do support graphics and animation.
Web browsers are not all created equal, and Web pages also will not be displayed the same in different browsers.
The browser operates at the application layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.

The **World Wide Web** is a system of Internet servers that support specially formatted documents. Web browsers are used to make it easy to access the World Wide Web. Browsers are able to display Web pages largely in part to an underlying Web protocol called HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP). HTTP defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands. It is what allows Web clients and Web servers to communicate with each other. When you enter a Web address (URL) in your browser, this actually sends an HTTP command to the Web server directing it to fetch and transmit the requested Web page and display the information in your browser. All Web servers serving Web sites and pages support the HTTP protocol.

**_Example:_** The URL to reach the definition of browser on Webopedia is: http://www.webopedia.com/browser.html
Once you enter the URL "http://www.webopedia.com/browser.html" into your address line, the browser breaks that Web address down into three distinct parts:

* The Protocol: "http"
* The server name: "www.webopedia.com"
* The file name, which follows the server name: "browser.html"

In order for your browser to actually connect to the Web server to retrieve the information you request, it communicates with a name server to translate the server name into an IP address. Your Web browser is then able to connect to the Web server at the resolved IP address on port 80. Once your browser has connected to the Web server using HTTP, the browser then reads the HyperText Markup Language (HTML), the authoring language used to create documents on the World Wide Web, and the data is then displayed in your Web browser.

## Functions of Browsers
Their main functionality is to present the web resource chosen, by requesting it from the server and displaying it on the browser window.
The resource format is a regularly hypertext markup language (HTML) document, containing PDF, image, flashes or some other type of content in an ordered manner. The location of the resource is specified by the user using a URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) or URL (Uniform Resource Locator).
The way the browser represents and displays HTML files is specified in the HTML and CSS specifications. These specifications are managed by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) organization, which is the standard organization for the web.
Browsers are not just good at viewing web pages, they can also be used to download and upload files as well. Browsers can facilitate the file transfer protocol (FTP). FTPs allow users to upload or download files to web servers using a browser.
