# HOW BROWSERS WORK
## Definition
**What is a Browser?**
A Web Browser or Browser as commonly refered, is a software application installed on a computer for retrieving, presenting, and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web.
An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI/URL) and may be a web page, image, video or other piece of content or technology.
Web pages and other resources are interprated by the browser which displays them on the screen.
Some browsers will translate only text while others do support graphics and animation.
Web browsers are not all created equal, and Web pages also will not be displayed the same in different browsers.
The browser operates at the application layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.
